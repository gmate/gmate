CHANGELOG

Version 1.2 (February 2010)
* Change the ' ' and '*' to '.' (Grep use dot as concat symbol)
* Small changes.

Version 1.1 (January 2010)
* Fix the project url from about dialog.

Version 1.0 (January 2010)
* Wrote the basic functionality. Now when you write a word the window will display all files that contain it. 
* Create some basic files, like: CHANGELOG, INSTALL, README, VERSION. 
* Upload sources to github repository.

Version 0.5 (December 2009)
* Added a simple filter to search process, now all image files (png, jpg, jpeg, gif, psd) are ignored; 
  this improve a little the performance and avoid that gedit hangs when try to search into 
  folders (like /myapp/public/galleries/), also you'll get less useless files listed as available.

Version 0.2 (December 2009)
* Fork the original sources of "Snap Open Plugin" from "gmate-gedit" project; learn the code and basic functionality. 
* Think about what I really need, and the original plugins didn't provide me. 
* Learn about python and bash trics.
